# JSFLibraryGenerator
A little XText project that's intended to make it simpler to create a JSF component library.

Creating a JSF library becomes - after a while - quite a repetive task. You have to maintain the taglib, you have to create the
component classes and you have to implement the renderer. Plus, the taglib doesn't read easily. Did I already mention the documentation pages?

The goal of this project is to generate these artifacts from a simple, legible and maintainable DSL language.

#State of the art
The XText/Xtend plugin is based on a *.jsfdsl file which describes the entire component suite of a JSF library. The *.jsfdsl
file, in turn, can be generated from a standard JSF taglib file by running the TaglibImporter class. The folder BootsFacesGeneratorDemo contains the 
*.jsfdsl generated by the TaglibImporter and the component skeletons of each of the 38 components of BootsFaces 0.6.7.

When you've installed the plugin in Eclipse (simply put the two files of the eclipse folders into the plugins folder of Eclipse),
you can generate the JSF component skeletons simply by editing and saving the *.jsfdsl file. Currently, it renders
- the component
- the renderer
- a taglib file which is complete, but only covers a single component
- and a documentation skeleton.

#What's left to do
- add the required CSS and Javascript files to the DSL and generate the @ResourceDependencies annotations
